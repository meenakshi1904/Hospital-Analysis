**Hospital-Analysis :** 

**Problem Statment:** Provide Insights to Revenue Team in Hospitality Domain

**Discription:** GDS Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the  hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, GDS Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of GDS Grands wanted to 
incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

**Tool Used:** MS Excel (CSV FILE),Power Bi ( reporting tool)

**Task:**
=> Create the metrics according to the metric list.
=> Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
=> Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up 
dashboard.
